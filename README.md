# DiceTacToe - 2023 project

WIP simple game concept coded in Python

**Goal:** 

Build a game that allows players to roll 6 dice and place them on a simple 9x9 game board to create a line of 3 in any direction

v1.0 functional minimum game: roll dice, store dice in list, update game board display (goal: Feb 2023)

v2 proposed: add complexity to the game board tiles allowing players to rotate dice +/1 1-3 numbers depending on the tile ability 
- initial rollout of multiple tile boards:  March 2023
- increase number of board options: April 2023

v3 future: develop GUI and turn into web-based app or mobile app

**Inspiration**

I enjoy playing simple phone games and I like the dice manipulation mechanic in the tabletop board game Intrepid. I'd like to sharpen my Python skills by creating a basic game, learning how to generate a web-based GUI for that game, and then progressively improving the code and adding features as a personal project througout 2023.
